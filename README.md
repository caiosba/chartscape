chartscape
==========

Inkscape extension to create charts. For the time being, it's possible to create just pie charts.

Install

Copy files chartscape.inx and chartscape.py to your Inkscape extensions directory.

Usage

Open Inkscape (reopen it if it was already opened before installing the extension) and click on Extensions > Render > Chartscape.

Choose a title, the values for the pie chart (separated by commas), and the diameter. Click 'OK'.

A whole chart will be rendered, grouped. You can ungroup and edit each part of the chart separetaly.

To Do

Thanks to my friends:

* Leandro Andrade, for correcting the labels positions
* Melissa Wen, for general improvements
* Aur√©lio Heckert, which presented to me he awesome world of Inkscape extensions development
